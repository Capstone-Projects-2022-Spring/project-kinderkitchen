# Project Abstract:

It's a mobile application, Kinder Kitchen, to help users combat food waste in their own homes. Kinder Kitchen allows users to track the expiration dates of their food to lower the amount of food waste they produce. Users will be able to scan the barcode located on the foodâ€™s packaging or enter the information manually. The app will help the user categorize the food they enter and show when each food expires. Users can receive notifications on food that is expiring soon within a set amount of time. Kinder Kitchen will also search the internet for recipes that utilize the food you have entered so that users can get creative with what they have on hand. In addition, Kinder Kitchen will help users locate local food banks to donate unused food if they are unable to use it in time
